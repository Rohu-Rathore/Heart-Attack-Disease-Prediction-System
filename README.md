# Heart-Attack-Disease-Prediction-System

About the Project

Heart disease is a global health issue that affects millions of people annually. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial in reducing the risk of severe complications. This project aims to build a web-based platform using Flask, MySQL, and machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The system allows users to input their health data and receive real-time predictions regarding their risk of heart disease. Additionally, users can provide feedback, share their experiences, and track their health history, making it a comprehensive solution for early detection and personalized care.



Features

Machine learning model that predicts heart disease based on patient data.

User-friendly web interface to input personal health details.

Patient history tracking to monitor previous predictions.

Feedback system for continuous improvement of the platform.

Future plans to explore new machine learning algorithms and enhance user experience.



Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
